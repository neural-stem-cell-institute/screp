# SCREP: single-cell RNA-Seq Enrichment Plots

The screp package provides to perform and visualize GO and pathway enrichment analysis of single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. The screp functions can perform enrichment tests for the Gene Ontology branches as well as pathway enrichments for Biocarta, KEGG, and Reactome pathway databases across the clusters of cells identified in scRNA-seq data. This analysis can then be visualized for the GO and Reactome analyses.
